This code implements a basic Library Management System using a database (likely MySQL). It's a command-line application, meaning the user interacts with it by typing commands. Here's how it works and how to use it:

Connect to Database: The program first tries to connect to your MySQL database. You need to configure the connection settings in the connect_mysql.py file. If the connection succeeds, it retrieves data for books, authors, and users.
Main Menu: The user is presented with a main menu:
Option 1: Book Operations: This allows you to manage books (add, borrow, return, search, list, delete).
Option 2: User Operations: This allows you to manage users (add, view details, list, delete).
Option 3: Author Operations: This allows you to manage authors (add, list, delete).
Option 4: Save and Exit: This saves the data to the database and text files (if you're using backups) and exits the program.
Sub-Menus: Each option has a sub-menu with specific operations. For example, the Book Operations sub-menu has options to add, search, borrow, return, etc.
User Interaction: The user interacts by selecting options from the menus and providing information when prompted (like book titles, author names, user details, etc.).

How to Use:

Set Up Database: Create a database named "library_db" (or whatever you prefer) with the required tables (books, authors, users) and their columns as described in the code.
Configure Database Connection: Update the connection settings in connect_mysql.py with the correct database credentials (hostname, username, password).
Run the Program: Run the main.py file.
Select Options: Use the menu options to manage books, users, and authors.
Exit: Select option 4 in the main menu to save your changes and exit the program.
